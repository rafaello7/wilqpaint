Wilqpaint
=========

Panting program for Linux. Based on MS Paint program idea.

Linux generally lacks a drawing program which would be similar to
the MS-Windows counterpart. All existing programs are either
poor or are heavy. So I have decided to write own program, which
is not so heavy (it uses only GTK+) but is good enough. In particular,
it has undo/redo, has a possibility do add text and has a possibility to
enlarge the image view.

The program was written primarily with the aim of adding notes on
screenshots. From this reason it has some unusual shapes like arrows. But
the program may be used also as generic painting program.


Note that the project is in beta stage now.
